## Hi there 👋 I'm Julian Weinelt

I'm Julian — a passionate developer, storyteller and creative mind from Germany.
When I write this, I'm 18 years old and already walking the digital path for over 8 years.

My journey started with programming a **LEGO Mindstorms EV3 robot**, and ever since, I've been fascinated by code and creation.
In 2019, I discovered my love for game development using the **Godot Engine** — and I never looked back. 🎮

Since 2021, **Java** has become my main language, and I now use it in a wide range of projects — from backend systems to multiplayer servers, bots, and desktop apps.
Besides Java and GDScript, I also work with **Python**, **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**, **C#**, **C++**, **Delphi**, **Pascal**, and even **Basic** — always driven by curiosity and a desire to learn.

### 💼 My biggest projects

#### 🛠️ [**Cäsar**](https://github.com/DeinLinkHier)

A powerful, modular **management tool for Minecraft servers**.
It integrates with CloudNet v4, offers full player moderation (bans, warns, mutes), JSON file editing, and even a visual interface via Godot. Discord integration included!

#### 🌐 **CodeBlocksMC**

A Minecraft server network I'm rebuilding from the ground up.
It features custom game modes like **PixelRacers**, **AmongCreepers**, and a full **citybuild economy** with companies, bank accounts, and a web-based UI. Java & Bedrock support!

#### 🎮 **Guardians of the Pixels** *(in development)*

A story-driven action-adventure game with pixel art, riddles, and mysterious machines.
It combines heartfelt storytelling with mechanics like ancient languages, unlockable companions (like a dog named **Jogi**) and a small flying robot friend named **B0B**.

#### 🎥 **IRL Horror Project**

A real-life mini-series inspired by games like *Phasmophobia*, featuring four ghost hunters exploring dark places with a haunting backstory. I'm responsible for story, tech, and atmosphere.

### 🚀 What I'm working on right now

* Expanding **Cäsar** with new modules and better UX
* Developing a **web-based operating system UI** with TailwindCSS
* Creating a custom **lobby & multiplayer server system** in Java using raw WebSockets
* Building a **game engine-inspired GUI system** for my projects
* Writing lore and quests for *Guardians of the Pixels*

### 🌱 Always learning

I'm a firm believer that good software tells a story — whether it's a tool, a server, or a game.
I'm currently diving deeper into:

* Advanced database design (MSSQL)
* Custom UI frameworks in Godot
* Clean architecture and modular software design
* Websocket-based real-time systems

### 📬 Let's connect

Got a cool idea, feedback, or just want to say hi?
I'm always open for collaboration, code talks, and creative chaos.
You can reach me via GitHub, Discord or my projects' forums.
